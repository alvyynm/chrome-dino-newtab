# Chrome Dino New Tab

Chrome Dino New Tab is a Chrome-exclusive extension that allows you to play Chrome's offline Dino game in your new tab.

When installed, opening a new tab will automatically display the Dino game. It doesn't matter whether your online or offline.

### Why?

I simply wanted to be able to play Dino without having to type chrome://dino in the browser. Sure, I can be lazy.

### Downsides

There are no enhancements to Chrome's Dino game that this extension provides. If you need a customizable Dino game, there are lots of them out there.

## Contribution

Wish to make a contribution to the project? Don't hesitate. Whether it's a recommendation or a suggestion, open an issue and I'll attend to it as soon as I can.

**_However, because of the nature of the extension, I don't plan to work on this project after publishing to the Chrome Web Store (Just in case Google sees it's worth listing)._**

Only maintenance updates will be issued to keep up with any changes Google makes. For instance, a major manifest version update.
